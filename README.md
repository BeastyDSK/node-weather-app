# node-weather-app

Hi There.

This is my first project on nodeJS.
I have created this application using HTML,CSS,JS and a bit NodeJS.

## Usage
This application can be used to know the weather(I know there are lots of application does the same thing even better. Just dont mention itüòÅ).

1) This application works both as a GUI app and also it provides an API that can be used to get realtime weather data (just temprature and stuff. Its not paid so dont expect more.)

Ex : /weather?lat=(lattitude)&lon=(longitude)
